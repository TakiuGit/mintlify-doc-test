title: "Availability DSL"

---


The Availability DSL allows you to express complex queries using a simple, readable syntax. This guide explains the
supported features, syntax, and provides practical examples.

## Basic Structure

A request is composed of one or more *clauses* combined with logical operators (`AND`, `OR`), *clauses* can be grouped
using parentheses for precedence.
- All whitespace are ignored except inside quoted values.
- All keywords and field names are case-sensitive unless otherwise specified.

**Examples**

- Find all the VOD in the catalog foo.
    ```SQL
    catalog = "foo" AND $type = "VOD"
    ```
- Find all VOD in the catalog foo and all the TV or CATCHUP in the lineup xyz
    ```SQL
    ($type = "VOD" AND catalog = "foo")
    OR
    ($type IN ("TV","CATCHUP") AND $lineup = "xyz")
    ```

## Clause composition

Clauses are composed with multiple elements

<Columns cols={2}>
    <Card title="Field" icon="list" href="./fields">
        Checkout how to describe a field.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Comparators" icon="list" href="./comparators">
        Checkout how to use a comparator in your queries.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Operators" icon="list" href="./comparators">
        Checkout how to use operators to compose queries.
    </Card>
</Columns>

- [Fields](./fields)
- [Comparators](./comparators)
- [Operators](./operators)

## Values

Values can be expressed with optional quotes when necessary.
Simple quote (`'`) and double quote `"` are supported.
Quotes can be escaped using backslash (`\`)

**examples:** `foo`, `"foo"`, `'foo'`, `"fo\"o"`
