# Comparators

This page describes information about operators that are used for advanced searching.

A comparator is one word which compares the value of a field on its left with one or more values on its right.

### EQ

**Syntax** : `EQ`,`=`

The `EQ` comparator is used to search for metadata containing the exact match for the specified field.

When passing multiples values, the `EQ` will search for an exact match. Meaning that if the content field has more
values it will not match the request
To find content where the value of the specified field must match multiple values, you may want to use the `AND`
operator instead.

**Examples**

```SQL Content with the catalog foo
catalog = foo
```

```SQL Content with exactly the catalog foo and bar
catalog = ("foo","bar")
```
---

### NEQ

**Syntax** : `NEQ`,`!=`

The `NEQ` comparator is used to search for metadata not containing the exact match for the specified field.

When passing multiples values, the `NEQ` will search for an exact match. Meaning that if the content field has more
values it will match the request.
To find content where the value of the specified field must not match multiple values, you may want to use the `NIN`
operator instead.

**Examples**

```SQL Content without the catalog foo
catalog != foo
```

```SQL Content without exactly the catalog foo and bar
catalog != ("foo","bar")
```
---

### IN

**Syntax** : `IN`

The `IN` comparator is used to search for metadata containing one of the match for the specified field.

Using `IN` is equivalent to using multiple `EQ` with a `OR` operator in a compact syntax.
`catalog IN ("foo","bar")` can be expressed as `catalog = foo OR catalog = bar`.

**Examples**


```SQL Content in the catalog foo
catalog IN foo
```

```SQL Content the catalog foo or bar
catalog IN ("foo","bar")
```

### NIN

**Syntax** : `NIN`

The `NIN` comparator is used to search for metadata not containing any of the match for the specified field.

Using `NIN` is equivalent to using multiple `NEQ` with a `AND` operator in a compact syntax.
`catalog NIN ("foo","bar")` can be expressed as `catalog != foo AND catalog != bar`.

**Examples**

```SQL Content without the catalog foo
catalog NIN "foo"
```

```SQL Content outside catalog foo and bar
catalog NIN ("foo","bar")
```
---

### ALL

**Syntax** : `ALL`

The `ALL` comparator is used to search for all metadata value in the specified field.
A content with the specified field containing more than the requested elements will match the request.

**Examples**

```SQL Content outside the catalog foo
catalog ALL "foo"
```

```SQL Content in catalog foo and bar
catalog ALL ("foo","bar")
```
