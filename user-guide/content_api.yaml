openapi: 3.0.0info:  version: 2.15.2  x-fromVersion: v2025r8  title: Content API   description: |    The Business API opens up functionality to external systems. This allows you to build integrations with Mediagenix Base platform     be it from a rights     management system, a MAM, an ESB, or any other system that needs information from or wants to push     information towards Mediagenix Base platform.    This OpenAPI definition describes the **Content API**, which exposes    content management functionality to external systems. It allows retrieving, searching, creating or updating programs,    episodes, seasons and series information in Mediagenix Base platform.servers:  - url: 'http://{host}:{port}/{basepath}'    variables:      host:        default: localhost      port:        default: '8888'      basepath:        default: content/v1  - url: '{url}/{basepath}'    variables:      url:        default: 'http://localhost:8888'      basepath:        default: content/v1security:  - JWT: []paths:  '/products/{contentId}':    get:      summary: Retrieve all details of a product regardless of type      description: |        The product is identified by the contentId (i.e. external reference).        The get will return all data, including customAttributes, press sheets and content images      tags:        - Products      parameters:        - name: contentId          in: path          required: true          schema:            type: string        - name: customAttributes          in: query          required: false          schema:             type: array            items:               type: string            description: 'Provide a list of the custom attribute attributenames to include these in the export.
