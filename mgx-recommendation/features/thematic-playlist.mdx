All titles in the Spideo database are indexed with semantic keywords (see **Semantics**. The more users interact with content, the more the Spideo algorithms can better understand their preferences and build their **Thematic profile.**

The “Thematic playlists” feature displays lines of automatically curated playlists based on each user’s favorite topics. Each line is presented as a combination of two keywords which are most relevant to each user’s tastes.

For instance, someone usually watching action movies and Marvel universe movies could have thematic playlists such as:

- “superheroes & spectacular”
- “beat the clock & martial arts”

Thematic playlists can be implemented with nature language phrases in order to have a closer connection with the users and allow discovery of content in a more human, intuitive manner. The previous 2 examples would therefore be presented as:

- “spectacular movies with superheroes”
- “martial arts movies with a countdown”

Thematic Playlists are usually being displayed as a “Because you like” rail, thus making a complete recommendation phrase:

- Because you like spectacular movies with superheroes
- For you - “martial arts movies with a countdown”

Thematic Playlists are a great tool to keep users engaged and help them explore the catalog while sticking to their favorite topics.

Adding one or two Thematic playlists to each user’s homepage on the platform can dramatically increase their watching habits.
