title="Saga"
description="Display titles which are part of the same saga."

Use the “Saga” endpoint to display all titles part of the same saga in a separate line.

For instance, it may be interesting to separately display all other Harry Potter films on a rail when any Harry Potter film is being consulted.

You could therefore have *Harry Potter and the prisoner of Azkaban,* a line of Similar titles but also a line of all other Harry Potter titles.

Important: Saga is also pre-existent in the Similar feature. If a film is part of a saga, the chronologically next title will appear first in the Similar recommendations line, as if it was boosted.

Using the same *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* example, in this situation the first film shown in the Similar line would be *Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire*, which is the 4th film in the Harry Potter Saga (*Prisoner of Azkaban* being the 3rd).

### Endpoint

```
GET /contents/{contentId}/saga
```

More details on the [API documentation](/dev/null)

### Use case

Depending on the User Interface, the Saga endpoint could be displayed in a separate clickable tab with a catchy title such as “Harry Potter Universe” or “Star Wars Universe”.

This way it is completely separated from the similar, “more like this” rail, being in a different tab.

### Did you know?

There is a specific priority order in a “Similar” line when titles are part of a specific situation such as “Saga”.

The priority order is the following:

1. Saga
2. Manually boosted
3. Boost list
4. Normal similar results.
