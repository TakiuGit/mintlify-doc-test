Autocomplete provides suggestions and related content from the catalog as the user is typing queries, based on either title, thematics or cast member name.

Autocomplete comes built-in with two subfeatures:

- **Typo tolerance**: Intuitive corrections to spelling mistakes.
- **Multi language search:** Recognition of queries all supported languages on the platform.

Therefore, someone typing “Matrx” will be shown entries corresponding to the *Matrix* movies, if available in the catalog.

### Endpoint

GET /suggestions?q={text}
