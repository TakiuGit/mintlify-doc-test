Direct Search is the feature through which search is performed with typo-tolerance and multi language settings applied and results are then displayed.

Use Direct Search to find content titles, star names (actresses, actors, directors etc), & their available filmographies and all Spideo keywords with their related titles.

Searching for content titles will display results where the typed words can be found in the titles. “Snowpiercer” will show the film and TV show of the same name, if available.

Searching for star names will display their available filmography, for instance searching for “Margot Robbie” will display available titles in which she plays a role.

Searching for keywords will display content titles which are most relevant in regards to the queried keyword.
