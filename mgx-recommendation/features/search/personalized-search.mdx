Personalized Search is a feature that allows users to find content based on their preferences, by  prioritizing results that are most relevant to their interests.

For example, if a user searches for the term "house," the feature will automatically search for and display results in the catalog ordered by their relevance according to the userâ€™s tastes and favorite content types.

If the user typically watches fantasy content, the search results will prioritize the show "House of the Dragon," while if they tend to watch medical dramas, the results will prioritize "Dr. House." Similarly, if they tend to watch political content, the results will prioritize "House of Cards."

This feature compares the keywords in the user's search query with their viewing history and  Semantic Profile to identify the most relevant results. The search results are then reordered based on the relevance of each result to the user's preferences.
