“Watch next” is a feature through which personalized recommendations can be displayed one by one instead of a rail. Users can then browse the available titles.

Depending on the use case and implementation, Watch Next can have an important impact on the engagement of the user. It allows spectators to focus on a specific title at a time instead of showing a line with all of them at once.

### Endpoint

```
GET /users/{user}/stepbystep/vod
```

More details on the [API documentation](/dev/null)

### Use case

One example of integrating Watch Next is right after a user has finished watching a movie or TV show. The browsing through personalized recommendations can continue without losing the “big screen” effect, as only one content will be displayed at a time.
