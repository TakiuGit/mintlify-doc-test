Top trending allows people to see the current most watched movies and shows on the platform.

Generated using data from [Explore Analytics](https://spideo.com/explore/), the top trending module is much more than just content pieces ordered by number of views. It takes into account temporal trends such as sudden rises in popularity or inconsistent usage patterns, in order to show the most accurate results of both short (daily, weekly) or long term (monthly, quarterly, timeless) trends.

Depending on your business model, top trending can be generated from user behaviour or simply most bought / rented content items.

### Endpoint

```
GET /top/{topId}/{universes}
```

### Use case

Top trending is one of the favorite features to be integrated high up on the platform homepage, since many views are generated from it and it is a valuable tool to fight churn.

It can be presented as a top 10 and up to top 50 line.sets every 24h to give users daily new ideas of content to watch.
