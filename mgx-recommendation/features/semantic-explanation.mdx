description="Explain why any title is recommended to the end user, either through similar titles they’ve already watched or through semantic pairs of keywords they usually interact with."

“Recommendations explained” is a feature which can show the reasoning behind any single recommendation. It can be displayed in 2 ways:

1. The name of the most relevant content related to the current title, e.g. *The Hobbit*  is being recommended to you because you watched *The Lord of the Rings*
2. A pair of keywords which is most accurate regarding the user’s recent interactions, e.g. *The Hobbit* is recommended to you because you like “fantasy and quests”.

“Recommendations explained” can be displayed on content files when a user consults them (if the personalized recommendation would be relevant to the user), or even underneath every content in a list of titles in a “Recommended for you” line. In the latter example, this does not mean every title would have the same argument. Therefore, a personalized recommendations line could be comoposed of: *The Hoobit*, because you like “fantasy and quests”, *Matrix*, because you like science fiction and martial arts, *The Lion King*, because you like Disney cartoons, etc
