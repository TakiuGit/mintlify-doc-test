## Integration steps
Integrate in 3 simple steps.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Week 1">
        **Setup and upload** your **catalog** in XML, JSON, or CSV via Spideo’s API.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Next 24 hours">
        We take the catalog you sent us and:
        1. prepare your databases
        2. configure your secured API endpoints

        We bring you through the API documentation and help with integration.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Last 2 to 3 weeks">
        You integrate Spideo. We assist with:

        1. starting with similar content-to-content, C2C recommendations
        2. and then evolving to personalized user-to-content, U2C recommendations
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Prepare for setup

### VOD and Catch-up
    Send your content catalog for our data crafters to analyze.

    We'll need the following metadata:
    - provider ID
    - series ID
    - season ID
    - content title
    - director’s name
    - content type
    - content availability
    - catch-up stores


###  Linear TV and EPG

#### EPG providers
    Do you work with **Gracenote**, **MediaPress**, **Redbee**, **Tivo**, others?

    Follow the standard linear TV integration process. Send us:
    - the list of TV channels eligible for recommendations
    - the name of each TV channel
    - the metadata provider’s ID correlated to each channel
    - the language used to broadcast each TV Channel
    - access to your EPG grid via API or FTP

#### Custom EPG

    Work with local metadata providers or use your own metadata?

    Follow the non-standard linear TV integration process. Send us:
    - the name of the TV channels
    - the ID of the TV channels
    - the language
    - the titles
    - airing time
    - short content descriptions

## Next step

Once everything is integrated with Spideo, we will provide you with:

### Metadata enrichment

We use semantic data to enrich 100% of your content catalogs and TV channels.\
We do daily ingestion of all TV programs 15 days in advance.\
We perform data enrichment 7 days in advance and immediately before broadcast.

### Daily import and export

We run automated import script every day, of faster depending on your needs.\
- Adding new incoming content
- Updating are removing old content

### User history

You can send the user interactions by:
- calling the API endpoint to directly push user interaction on the go
- sending history file on a daily basis

## Understanding the rules

Our content recommendation strategy follows best-practices.

- We don't hide or store any data in the STB. Each interaction sends a request to Spideo’s API.
- We collect no sensitive data and complies with GDPR.
