## Prepare for setup

### VOD and Catch-up

Send your content catalog for our data crafters to analyze.

We'll need the following metadata:

- provider ID
- series ID
- season ID
- content title
- director’s name
- content type
- content availability
- catch-up stores

### Linear TV and EPG

#### EPG providers

Do you work with **Gracenote**, **MediaPress**, **Redbee**, **Tivo**, others?

Follow the standard linear TV integration process. Send us:

- the list of TV channels eligible for recommendations
- the name of each TV channel
- the metadata provider’s ID correlated to each channel
- the language used to broadcast each TV Channel
- access to your EPG grid via API or FTP

#### Custom EPG

Work with local metadata providers or use your own metadata?

Follow the non-standard linear TV integration process. Send us:

- the name of the TV channels
- the ID of the TV channels
- the language
- the titles
- airing time
- short content descriptions

## Next step

Once everything is integrated with Spideo, we will provide you with:

### Metadata enrichment

We use semantic data to enrich 100% of your content catalogs and TV channels.\
We do daily ingestion of all TV programs 15 days in advance.\
We perform data enrichment 7 days in advance and immediately before broadcast.

### Daily import and export

We run automated import script every day, of faster depending on your needs.\\

- Adding new incoming content
- Updating are removing old content

### User history

You can send the user interactions by:

- calling the API endpoint to directly push user interaction on the go
- sending history file on a daily basis

## Understanding the rules

Our content recommendation strategy follows best-practices.

- We don't hide or store any data in the STB. Each interaction sends a request to Spideo’s API.
- We collect no sensitive data and complies with GDPR.
