## Basic Structure

A request is composed of one or more *clauses* combined with logical operators (`AND`, `OR`), *clauses* can be grouped
using parentheses for precedence.
- All whitespace are ignored except inside quoted values.
- All keywords and field names are case-sensitive unless otherwise specified.

**Examples**

```SQL Find all the VOD in the catalog foo.
catalog = "foo" AND $type = "VOD"
```

```SQL Find all VOD in the catalog foo and all the TV or CATCHUP in the lineup xyz
($type = "VOD" AND catalog = "foo")
OR
($type IN ("TV","CATCHUP") AND $lineup = "xyz")
```

## Clause composition

Clauses are composed with multiple elements

    <Card title="Field" icon="list" href="./fields">
        Checkout how to describe a field.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Comparators" icon="list" href="./comparators">
        Checkout how to use a comparator in your queries.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Operators" icon="list" href="./comparators">
        Checkout how to use operators to compose queries.
    </Card>
</Columns>

## Values

Values can be expressed with optional quotes when necessary.
Simple quote (`'`) and double quote `"` are supported.
Quotes can be escaped using backslash (`\`)

**examples:** `foo`, `"foo"`, `'foo'`, `"fo\"o"`
