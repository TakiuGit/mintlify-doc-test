# Comparators

This page describes information about operators that are used for advanced searching.

A comparator is one word which compares the value of a field on its left with one or more values on its right.

### IN

**Syntax** : `IN`, `=`

The `IN` comparator is used to search for metadata containing one of the match for the specified field.

When passing multiple values, any of the value quested are searched in order to find a match.
Meaning that `catalog IN ("foo","bar")` can be expressed as `catalog = foo OR catalog = bar`.

**Examples**

```SQL Content in the catalog foo
catalog IN foo
```

```SQL Content the catalog foo or bar
catalog IN ("foo","bar")
```

### NIN

**Syntax** : `NIN`, `!=`

The `NIN` comparator is used to search for metadata not containing any of the match for the specified field.
This includes content that do not contain the specified field.

When passing multiple values, any of the value quested are searched in order to reject a match
`catalog NIN ("foo","bar")` can be expressed as `catalog != foo OR catalog != bar`.

<Note>
    `"catalogs" NIN "foo"` does not produce the same result as `NOT ("catalogs" IN "foo")` as `IN` ensure the field
    existence
</Note>

**Examples**

```SQL Content without the catalog foo
catalog NIN "foo"
```

```SQL Content outside catalog foo or bar
catalog NIN ("foo","bar")
```
---

### ALL

**Syntax** : `ALL`

The `ALL` comparator is used to search for all metadata value in the specified field.
A content with the specified field containing more than the requested elements will match the request.

**Examples**

```SQL Content outside the catalog foo
catalog ALL "foo"
```

```SQL Content in catalog foo and bar
catalog ALL ("foo","bar")
```
